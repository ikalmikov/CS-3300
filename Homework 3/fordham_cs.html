                                they're so central to our information-driven global society.

                                The computer science major emphasizes science and technology, 
                                including software design and programming, computer architecture 
                                and functions, and the development of an ability to analyze and 
                                solve problems in using the computer as a tool.

                        You'll learn more than computer science here. You'll also study philosophy, 
                        theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the performing arts through 
                        Fordham's common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education. 
                        We want you to excel in your fieldâ€”and as a human being.
