4. What is the DOM? What is meant by the DOM tree?
    DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a tree like data structure that 
    represents the structure of the html page elements. Each node represents an 
    element, text content, attribute. The DOM uses a hierarchical structure with 
    surrounding tags/elements being a parent node to the elements within it. 
    The DOM gives us a nicer way to modify the structure of our html code using 
    functions like createElement and appendChild.  

5. What is a XSS attack? How do they work? How can you guard against them?
    A Cross-Site Scripting is when a user can input malicious script into an input
    field and the website runs this malicious script even when other users access.
    This can allow the hacker to access other user's personal data.
    To prevent XSS attacks we have to be caerful of the user input data that we 
    use as HTML. We must validate user data and ensure they are inputing
    valid and safe data.
