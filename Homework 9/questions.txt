1. What is SQL? What are relational databases?
    SQL stands for Structure Query Language. It is programming language  designed for managing data
    held in relational database systems. With SQL, we can do commands like adding, updating, deleting, 
    retrieving, and manipulating data within a database. 
    A relational database is a type of database where different entities can be related to one another. 
    It stores data into tables/columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. The relationships
    between data is based on the characteristics of the entities.

4. What is a PDO in PHP? Why do we need to use prepared statements?
    PDO stands for PHP Data Objects. It is a PHP extension that allows us to perform database operations using
    the same PHP code for different kinds of databases.
    Prepared statements are a feature in the PDO that allows us to execute the same SQL statements with high efficiency. 
    They are parsed and compiled only once, which allows for efficiency and can be executed many times with different values. 
    They also help prevent SQL injection attacks as they help seperate the logic of the code from the data.
