2. What are some examples of how PHP and JavaScript are alike and how they differ?
    PHP and JavaScript are both scripting languages used for web development. 
    However, PHP is used on the server side/backend and JS is used on the client side/frontend.
    They both support functions, objects, if statements, and both assign variable types upon interpetation.
    In php all variables are defined with a $, while in JS we can use let, var, and const for different purposes and scopes.
    JS also allows for asynchronous functions, while default PHP does not.
